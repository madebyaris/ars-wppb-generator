# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Generator

A Node.js small application to generate a custom zip file based on the WPPB extended by Aris Setiawan ( [https://github.com/madebyaris/ars-wppb-generator](https://github.com/madebyaris/ars-wppb-generator) ).

This app will find and replace plugin-name, Plugin_Name, plugin_name and author information from the original code and will send a zip file with the new code, ready to use.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/madebyaris/ars-wppb-generator.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd ars-wppb-generator
$ npm install
$ node server
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
